  I am currently a third-year doctoral student at Brown University School of Public Health. Born and raised in a Bhutanese refugee camp in eastern Nepal, I lived in the camp for nearly 17 years before resettling with my family in Springfield, MA, in 2011. I earned an MPH degree from the Brown University School of Public Health. Before attending Brown, I served as a Community Advisory Board (CAB) member in Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) with Dr. Theresa Betancourtâ€™s Research Program on Children and Adversity (RPCA) at the Boston College School of Social Work, where I assisted to investigate cultural norms and traditions related to family-strengthening interventions.

My research interests focus on addressing the challenges faced by refugee communities and other marginalized populations. Specifically, I seek to explore: (1) how socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and religion/faith influence mental health, depression, and suicidal ideation; (2) why marginalized populations and low-income communities experience significant health disparities; and (3) how to leverage resources to improve mental health service delivery. Ultimately, I aim to design and implement culturally congruent Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI-R) for refugee and immigrant populations in the U.S. and low- to middle-income nations.

## Public Health and Psycho-social Well-Beings

<p align="justify">
I am interested in conducting mental health interventions and implementation among refugee populations in the U.S. and low- and middle-income nations. Currently, I am collecting data for a study titled "Assessing Mental Health and Psychosocial Well-being among Bhutanese Refugees and Outpatients in Nepal: A Cross-sectional Study" with guidance from mentors and supervisors: <a href = "https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jproulx">Dr. Jeffrey Proulx</a>, Assistant Professor at Brown University School of Public Health; <a href = "https://vivo.brown.edu/display/rabid">Dr. Ruhul Abid</a>, Professor of Surgery at Brown Alpert Medical School; and <a href = "https://vivo.brown.edu/display/msarker1">Dr. Malabika Sarkar</a> at Brown University School of Public Health, Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences.

## Family Strengthing Intervention among Refugees (FSI-R)

<p align="justify">
I was a Community Advisory Board (CABs) consultant and co-facilitator for the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R) in <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/ssw/faculty/faculty-directory/theresa-betancourt.html">Dr. Theressa Betancourt's</a> Research Program in Children and Adversity Lab. Along with co-facilitating weekly Community Co-Design Group sessions, my duties also include offering comments on protocol drafts and helping to finalize it. I have developed various skills in planning, carrying out, and assessing interventions, publishing manuscripts, and sharing the results with a broader audience in various contexts, including community, national, and worldwide conferences.This feedback process and co-design approach have deepened my understanding of effectively incorporating Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) to ensure our strategies are culturally sensitive and contextually appropriate.
